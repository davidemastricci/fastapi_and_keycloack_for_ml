In this repo, I will guide you through building a small FastAPI server that serves your ML model, allowing you to send requests and receive responses with ease.

Additionally, we will demonstrate how to add authentication and authorization around a route using Keycloak, ensuring the security of your application.

By following this step-by-step approach, you will quickly learn the main concepts of FastAPI+Keycloak and how to use them to create robust and production-ready APIs that implement best practices by default.
